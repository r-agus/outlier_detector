title LSTM Model for Disruption Classification - Technical Workflow

partition "Feature Engineering" {
  :Load time series data for each discharge;
  :Segment time series into windows;
  :Create sequence data with lookback window;
  note right: Temporal features preserve sequence information
  
  :Reshape data to [samples, timesteps, features];
  :Scale features using StandardScaler;
  note right: Store scaler for later prediction
  
  :Split X_lstm into training/test sets;
  note right: Stratified split by disruption label
}

partition "Model Architecture" {
  :Initialize LSTM network;
  :Add LSTM layer;
  note right: Units=64, return_sequences=True
  
  :Add Dropout layer;
  note right: rate=0.2, prevent overfitting
  
  :Add LSTM layer;
  note right: Units=32
  
  :Add Dropout layer;
  note right: rate=0.2
  
  :Add Dense output layer;
  note right: sigmoid activation

  :Compile model;
  note right: binary_crossentropy loss
  
  :Fit model on training data;
  note right: batch_size=32, epochs=50
  
  :Track validation loss;
  note right: Early stopping callback
  
  :Save best model weights;
}

partition "Prediction Pipeline" {
  :Prepare timestep sequences;
  note right: prepare_lstm_features_for_single_discharge()
  
  :Apply same scaling as training;
  note right: Uses stored lstm_scaler
  
  :Reshape for LSTM input;
  note right: [samples, timesteps, features]
  
  :Forward pass through model;
  
  :Apply threshold to probabilities;
  note right: p >= 0.5 â†’ Disruptive (1)
  
  :Return binary prediction;
