start

partition Initialization {
  :Initialize DisruptionClassifier with data paths;
}

partition "Data Loading" {
  :Load discharge list with disruption labels;
  :Load feature data for all discharges;
  note right: Processes data from 7 different features
}

partition "Model Training" {
  :Prepare features for OCSVM, IForest, LSTM;
  note right: Each model uses different feature representations
  
  :Split data into training and test sets;
  
  fork
    :Scale and train OCSVM model;
  fork again
    :Train Isolation Forest model;
  fork again
    :Train LSTM model;
  end fork
  
  :Predict on test set with each model;
  :Evaluate individual model performance;
  
  :Align predictions by discharge ID;
  :Combine predictions (majority voting);
  :Evaluate combined model performance;
}

partition "Analysis" {
  :Analyze test set in detail;
  note right: Runs predictions on all test discharges
  
  :Calculate overall metrics;
  note right: Accuracy, precision, recall
  
  :Predict for sample discharges;
  note right: Applies all models to specific cases
}
